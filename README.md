# laravel-news-crud

https://packagist.org/packages/sevenpluss/laravel-news-crud

I added into dependency the Debugbar immediately after installation can be tested

__Minimum requirements:__ Laravel 5.4+, php7.1+ (because use anywhere type hiting)

#### Install steps:

#### 1  install package.

from console use command

```shell
composer require sevenpluss/laravel-news-crud
```

__or__ find the package in dependency manager in your IDE and install

```shell
sevenpluss/laravel-news-crud
```

__or__ use composer.json

```shell
"sevenpluss/laravel-news-crud": "^1.0"
```
then run the command

```shell
composer update
```

#### 2 add service provider of package into file `config/app`

```php
'providers' => [
   ...
   Sevenpluss\NewsCrud\NewsCrudServiceProvider::class,
   ...
]
```

> Laravel 5.5 uses Package Auto-Discovery, so doesn't require you to manually add the ServiceProvider

Let make sure that the model __App\User.php__ stored in the default location.
Ok, next files from the box is not touched.


#### 3 - add the files from the package such migration, configs, locale ...etc.

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish
```

#### 4 run the migration tables for database

```shell
php artisan migrate 
```

next run command right is very, very necessary (or will generated an error that the class is not found)
```
composer dumpautoload
```

#### 5 fill database the test data

```shell
php artisan db:seed --class=CrudDatabaseSeeder
```

the tables should be seeding in the following order
```php
Seeding: CategoriesTableSeeder
Seeding: CrudUsersTableSeeder
Seeding: PostsTableSeeder
Seeding: CommentsTableSeeder
Seeding: TagsTableSeeder
```

It all, package ready for use.

> seeding test data, 1 from 20 can be broken (guilty __Faker__), just rollback the migration and repeat __step 5__
